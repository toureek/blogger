## Utils  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I built my first Hackintosh yesterday and I did clean reinstall Fedora27 XFCE4 on the laptop tonight, and I also upgraded to the latest operating system on mac. I built up the basic developing environment that required on both side platforms. I guess there will be a little help in writing down the tips on Fedora/Mac for anyone who visits this webpage.


+ Fedora  
    * [Shadowsocks-qt5](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-qt5). &nbsp; A proxy util for surfing Internet freely that can work well with [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/).
    * [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) and its [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation). &nbsp; Plugin for subline text.
    * [OmniMarkupPreviewer](https://github.com/timonwong/OmniMarkupPreviewer). &nbsp; Plugin for subline text which can edit and preview the markdown file in Web Browser.
    * JSONView or JSON-handle plugins on Firefox and Chrome for formating JSON response in web browser.
    * [Teamviewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/). &nbsp; It <b>only</b> works in <b>Xorg Mode</b> on [Fedora](https://community.teamviewer.com/t5/Linux/TeamViewer-12-not-connect-in-Fedora-25/td-p/2817).</b>&nbsp; Crossing platforms tool among Mac, Windows, Linux and mobiles. Remote control, meeting, file transfering, etc.  
    * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). &nbsp; I used to use [WeChat for Web](http://web.wechat.com) on Linux, but I begin to use a windows virtual machine instead of it. There is an [issue](./Readings/Install-VirtualBox-In-A-Right-Way.md) during clean installing VirtualBox and sytem upgrading on Linux platform.   


+ Mac  
	* [Mounty for NTFS](http://enjoygineering.com/mounty/). &nbsp; Windows NTFS files can be read and write on Mac.
	* [Shadowsocks project for all platforms](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html).
	* [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com). &nbsp; A pretty easier tiny markdown editor with preview on mac.
	* [TNEF's Enough for Mac OS](http://www.joshjacob.com/mac-development/tnef.php).  &nbsp; It can open Microsoft TNEF stream files on mac, for instance, .dat file in Surface mail attachments.
